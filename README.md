  I created a personal portfolio webpage to show my projects and skills.
The webpage is responsive and works well on desktop and mobile.
It includes sections like About Me, Projects, and Contact, with smooth navigation. 
I used HTML and CSS to design a clean layout and added simple interactive features like social media icons and button effects. 
This task helped me learn basic web design and front-end development.
